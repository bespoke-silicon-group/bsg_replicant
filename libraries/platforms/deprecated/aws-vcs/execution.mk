# All simulations should run with +ntb_random_seed_automatic.
# 
# From the VCS MX User-Guide: +ntb_random_seed_automatic Picks a unique value to
# supply as the first seed used by a testbench. The value is determined by
# combining the time of day, host name and process id. This ensures that no two
# simulations have the same starting seed.

# OK, here's where things get complicated. 

# Each regression that generates a waveform generates it in the .<test_name>
# directory, named vcdplus.vpd. To generate a waveform we must provide the
# following arguments to the simulation through SIM_ARGS.

# Generating a waveform requires a simulation binary compiled with different VCS
# flags. We call this binary <test_name>.debug, and its build rule is defined in
# link.mk.
#
# UNIFIED_TESTS all use test_loader.debug. INDEPENDENT_TESTS use their own
# top-level. Encode dependencies for each differently.
#
# The ORDER of these dependencies are important because the actual rule uses $<
# to get the name of the executable.

# Normal cosimulation requires a simulation binary without waveform flags (it
# executes faster...). We call this binary <test_name>, and its build rule is
# defined in link.mk.
#

# that corresponds to their <test_name>. Encode dependencies for each
# differently.

# These are the execution rules for the binaries. We define TEST_NAME so that it
# can be used in C_ARGS, and LOG_NAME so that we can write a log. If a waveform
# is being generated, then it writes to <test_name>.debug.log, otherwise
# <test_name>.log. Finally, depend on <test_name>.rule so that we rebuild the
# RISC-V binaries.
